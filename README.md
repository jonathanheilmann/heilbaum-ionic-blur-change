# @heilbaum/heilbaum-ionic-blur-change
`@heilbaum/heilbaum-ionic-blur-change` provides an Ionic 2 directive to detect changes on input blur and emits an event.

## Example
See [demo.heilbaum.de/heilbaum-ionic-blur-change/](https://demo.heilbaum.de/heilbaum-ionic-blur-change/)

## Installation
1. Install via npm
    npm install @heilbaum/heilbaum-ionic-blur-change --save
2. Add `BlurChangeModule` to `src/app/app.modules.ts`
    ```typescript
    @NgModule({
     imports: [
         BlurChangeModule
     ]
    })
    ```

<ion-input id="someInput"
           name="someInput"
           placeholder="Some input"
           type="text"
           value="Some input"
           (blurChange)="onBlurChange($event)">
</ion-input>
```
